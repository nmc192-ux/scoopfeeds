# Phase A — Retrospective Inputs

This file accumulates findings during Phase A execution. Sprint 6's
formal Phase A Retrospective will synthesize these into structured
lessons.

## Sprint 1 findings

### 1. Brief inaccuracies surfaced in 3 of 4 code issues
Issues 1.3 (auth model), 1.4 (translation gap), 1.5 (cost framing)
each had Brief framings that investigation corrected. Future Phase
Briefs should build investigation phases into every issue by default,
not as exceptions.

### 2. Translation pipeline produces poor-quality Urdu output
Discovered via Issue 1.4 production deploy. Mojibake characters
in translated content; partial translations leaving English mixed
with Urdu. Affects: AI service routing, source content pipeline,
UI rendering. Phase B/C investigation needed.

### 3. Mixed English-Urdu content in RTL mode creates UX problems
Even when individual translations are clean, English-source content
displayed in RTL layout reads badly. Phase B/C should consider
per-content-direction handling.

### 4. Hostinger GitHub auto-deploy disconnection
Exact cause unclear; manual redeploys work fine. Don't investigate
mid-Phase-A unless it becomes painful.

### 5. Codex's prior hardening was more thorough than Brief credited
Admin auth was already enforced globally before Sprint 1 began.
Issue 1.3 was code clarity, not a security fix. The Brief's framing
("close fail-open gap") was incorrect; the commit message corrected it.

### 6. Smoke test design referenced non-existent metric
Sprint 1 Issue 1.5 smoke test referenced `lastTimelineBuilderRun`
field in `/api/health` that doesn't exist. Future smoke-test plans
should verify metric existence before shipping. For timeline-builder
specifically, post-deploy verification needs to be log-based or
DB-based — or add instrumentation as part of Sprint 3 metrics work.

### 7. Alarm response to ambiguous data needs calibration
Article count drops and uptime resets are normal in cloud hosting;
not every anomaly is a bug signal. First diagnostic should always
be "is this metric meaningful?" before "is this metric broken?"
